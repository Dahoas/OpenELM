{"result": "The AI software developed by OpenAI is called GPT-3, which stands for Generative Pretrained Transformer 3. It is an example of an artificial intelligence model that uses machine learning to produce human-like text. GPT-3 can generate sentences, paragraphs, or even entire articles that are nearly indistinguishable from human-written text. It is powered by machine learning algorithms that have been trained on a diverse range of internet text and can generate coherent, relevant, and even creative text based on"}

{"result": "AI can be described as a branch of computer science that focuses on the development of intelligent machines that work, react and learn like humans. It involves the creation of algorithms that allow machines to learn from data and use that learning to make predictions or decisions. AI applications can include tasks such as speech recognition, problem-solving, learning, planning, natural language understanding and more. AI has the potential to revolutionize various industries including healthcare, education, finance, and transportation."}
